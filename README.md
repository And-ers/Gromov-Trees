# Gromov-Trees

Included in this repository is an .ipynb file containing an implementation of the algorithm discussed in [Gromov's Approximating Tree and the All-Pairs Bottleneck Paths Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05338) by Anders Cornect (myself) and Dr. Eduardo Martinez-Pedroza of Memorial University of Newfoundland.

Given a NetworkX graph, the code in this Notebook returns its Gromov's Approximating Tree (also as a NetworkX graph). There is also an example, along with some further detail about its use, at the end of the notebook.
